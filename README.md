# ChaoticSimulations

Many of the real-world chaotic systems we deal with as engineers, mathematicians, and scientists can be described and further analyzed. This project done in Matplotlib and Pygame uses differetial equations to simulate some chaotic systems well-known in the field of chaos theory. A report is provided which gives a detalied analysis of the chaotic systems highlighted using non-linear differntial equation analysis techniques learned in MATH 2552 at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
